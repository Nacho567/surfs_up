# Surfs Up
Mod 9: Advanced Storage

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

This data analysis was created to help W. Avy get a better idea of how his surf and ice cream shop might fare in the months of June and December in Oahu. Specifically, we looked at varying statistics of the temperatures for both months (average, min, max, etc).

## **Results**

- The biggest takeaway is that both months have almost the same temperature stats.

![December temps](https://github.com/Nacho567/surfs_up/blob/315b78a15b981deb0581d109951f8f9deb7b1843/Dec_stats.png)

- December is naturally "colder" overall, but that's relative and most people should still want ice cream on an average 71 degree day.

- December does have a low temp of 56 degrees which is almost 10 degrees lower than June.

## **Summary**

After analyzing the data, it looks as though W. Avy should be able to sell ice cream year round! W. Avy might want to look at a couple more data points though, one being precipitation for the two months. While both should be warm enough for ice cream, for example if December is a rainier month that would affect sales. He could also look at the temperature and precipitation for other locations, to have a backup location that might be more suitable.
